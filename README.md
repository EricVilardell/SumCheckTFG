# Sumcheck Protocol - Final Degree Project (TFG)

This repository contains the code and documentation developed for my final degree project on the Sumcheck protocol, a core interactive proof technique used in complexity theory and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Contents

- Naive implementation of the Sumcheck protocol
- Optimized linear-time version
- Numerical examples to illustrate each protocol

## Reference
Based on lecture notes by Justin Thaler (2017) and other sources cited in the TFG.
